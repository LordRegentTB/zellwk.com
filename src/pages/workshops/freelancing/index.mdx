I know you're frustrated because you've seen people getting hired and getting freelance jobs on the internet every day.

They're celebrating their success and flaunting the money they have, while you're sitting in front of your computer, wondering when you will be able to achieve the same amount of success.

What if all the time you've invested into learning to code gets wasted? When will you ever become good enough to get clients yourself and enjoy the same amount of success?

You don't feel you're ready. And you don't know how to begin.

Most people think you need to have incredible skills to freelance as a web developer, but this cannot be further from the truth.

## You don't need to have amazing skills to freelance

**You only need to know some HTML, some CSS, some JavaScript**, and you're already good enough to begin.

No need for React or any of the advanced stuff.

I know this because **I began to freelance when I have less than 1 year of web development skills (self-taught) under my belt**, and I earned a sum of money equivalent to a full-time employee.

And I didn't even need to put a lot of work into my freelance search process — because back then I was still in school and I had to dedicate most of my time to school work.

So yes, **there is an effective process you can use to meet and get freelance clients.**

**I'm not the only one who got results from what I'm about to share with you about freelancing.**

Last year, I ran a 3h workshop where I coached several people on how to get a job in the industry.

**One of my students used what I taught and clinched not one, but two, freelance deals within a single week** — even though she was trembling with fear when she attended my workshop.

So if you've at least one year of web development experience (self-taught or otherwise) under your belt, the question you should have isn't "am I good enough to freelance".

The real question you should be asking is "how do I begin", so you can do what you enjoy for a living, and make great money while doing so.

Now, I'm going to reveal one of the most important pieces you need to understand on the next page. For free. So pay attention and buckle up if you're interested to learn more.
