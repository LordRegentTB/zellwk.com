I'm going to hold a workshop series on mastering APIs. This workshop is going to be four sessions long and **I want to invite you to the first session for free**.

And no, I won't be pitching or selling anything in on this first session — I'm just going to give you good content like I always do, especially when I'm teaching.

**These four sessions will be revolving around the following topics:**

1. Learning what an API is and how to use it
2. Handling Authentication and Open Authorization
3. Building your own APIs with Node
4. Learning to use Webhooks

## Date and timings

These workshops will be held on **Tuesdays, 10am Singapore time**.

- Session 1: 28 March
- Session 2: 4 April
- Session 3: 11 April
- Session 4: 18 April

Each session will last for 1 hour, and we will have 30 mins Q&A — so **each session will be a total of 1.5 hours**.
