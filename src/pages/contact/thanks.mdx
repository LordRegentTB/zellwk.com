Thanks for reaching out! I've sent both of us an email. You should see it in your mailbox soon.

**Please note:** Although I read every email, I don't have the capacity to respond to everyone. I'll only reply if your request aligns with my goals.

If I don't get back to you for some reason, please nudge me gently by replying to the email. Thanks! :)
