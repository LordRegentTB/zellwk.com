Welcome! You have just made a wonderful decision that's going to change everything you know about JavaScript.

**Being great JavaScript is no longer a dream** — it's going to become a reality — because you now access to the materials that give you a strong JavaScript foundation.

With this strong foundation, you'll go on and become amazing at JavaScript incredibly quickly. (Others may have to take years but you'll become great enough in a couple of months).

## You're in good hands.

**We've helped so many people understand and use JavaScript fluently that we've stopped counting how many people we've helped**.

Almost everyone who stepped through our doors thought JavaScript was hard when they started. But through our clear and understandable training, they all felt JavaScript become simple and easy — almost second-nature withou our help.

And they went on and became excellent JavaScript developers who can use React, Astro, Vue, Express and other advanced JavaScript frameworks easily.

Today, we're excited to help you.

## We've sent some instructions to your email inbox.

If you check your inbox you should find some instructions to login to our JavaScript course.

- Read through those lessons.
- Do the exercises.
- Build the stuff we ask you to build.

By the end of these 3 chapters, you'll be able to think like a developer.

See you in the lessons!

## One more thing!

We put in a lot of effort to make these lessons as clear and understandable.

We'd love to give these 3 chapters to as many people as we can.
