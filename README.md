# Pages to port over

- Best -> Rework this to include stuff from GA (and stuff I want to promote) -> Probably need a different way to showcase articles...
- ~~Shiki Theming -> For new blog we might have to change the theme colors. Using Dracula for now.~~
- Lighthouse stuff -> Check again after publishing, then fix.
- Products -> Using the Text Tab thingy?

Improvements

- Further Reading — (Include my courses here if any)
- Related Articles — Get Related Articles
- Popular Posts — Require some data from GA if I want to populate this automatically, but should I?
- Google Structured Data — Yes please. Figure it out later.
- Webmentions
- Automatic Social Media Image Generation
  - Large OG Image
  - Small OG Image
- Tag Manager
  - Figure out how to remove localhost from Tag Manager (or how to disable the events when using it locally).
  - Determine `content_name` for FB / Twitter for Lead (if any). <-- THIS IS NEXT
  - Figure out how to send user email over to FB so it tracks the people accurately...
    - FB is not for the Pixel setup.
